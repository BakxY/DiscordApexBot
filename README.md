# DiscordApexBot

This is a simple discord bot for viewing stats from the battle royal game Apex Legends. It is using the Apex Legends API of HugoDerave. You can find his repo [here](https://github.com/HugoDerave/ApexLegendsAPI)

It is all written in python3. It is currently not optimized, but I'm going to get to it soon. I'm not the best at python and in fact I don't like it, but it's the simplest for programming discord bots, so I'm stuck with it.

## Run it yourself

If you wish to run this bot yourself, you will have to create a bot in your [discord developer portal](https://canary.discord.com/developers/applications) and get an apex API key from [here](apexlegendsapi.com/documentation.php). Then just paste your keys into the corresponding files, you don't need to add any brackets or anything else.  (If you create issues or want to create a pull request on the project, please remove your API keys.)

## I found a issue

If you find issues with the bot, please create an issue or if you have a solution, a branch a pull request.
